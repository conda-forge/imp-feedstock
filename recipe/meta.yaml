  summary: "The Integrative Modeling Platform"
  description: >
    IMP's broad goal is to contribute to a comprehensive structural
    characterization of biomolecules ranging in size and complexity from small
    peptides to large macromolecular assemblies, by integrating data from
    diverse biochemical and biophysical experiments. IMP provides an open
    source C++ and Python toolbox for solving complex modeling problems, and a
    number of applications for tackling some common problems in a user-friendly
    way. IMP can also be used from the
    [Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) molecular modeling system,
    or via one of several web applications.

    See [the IMP website](https://integrativemodeling.org/) for more details.
